## Saurabh Daware (he/him) ðŸŒ»

I love open-source! On my GitHub, You will find NPM libraries and other (mostly) JavaScript-based projects. I am currently working on creating a new static-site-generator [@abelljs](https://github.com/abelljs)

When I'm not coding, I love reading about Astronomy and bragging about the things I make on [My Twitter](https://twitter.com/saurabhcodes).

If you like what I do and want me to build more such projects, maybe consider becoming a patron or buying me a coffee  ðŸ¥ºðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ
